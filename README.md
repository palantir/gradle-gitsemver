# gitsemver plugin for gradle

## Why?

To create an alternative to `git describe` that works nicely with git flow and automatically updates project versions.

## How does it work?

1. Find all tags accessable from HEAD
2. Use a slightly modified semantic versioning scheme to sort tags
3. Choose the 'largest' tag and append to the build portion of version if tag != HEAD:
   * number of commits since that tag
   * the git hash in the format g01ABCDEF
   * the dirty state of the repo

### Example:

Suppose we have a git history that looks like this (newest on top):

```
* eeeeeee - (HEAD, develop) fix a bug <EA>
* ddddddd - merge 'feature/stuff' into 'develop' <EA>
|\
| * ccccccc - (feature/stuff) my feature is done <EA>
* | bbbbbbb - (tag: v0.1.0-dev) preparing develop branch <EA>
|/
* aaaaaaa - (master, tag: v0.0.0) Initial commit <EA>
```

For each ref that I could checkout, the version would be:

* `master`: v0.0.0
* `bbbbbb`: v0.1.0-dev
* `feature/stuff`: v0.0.0+1.gccccccc
* `ddddddd`: v0.1.0-dev+2.gddddddd
* `eeeeeee`: v0.1.0-dev+3.geeeeeee

Finally, if I were on the develop branch and had uncommitted changes the version would be v0.1.0-dev+3.geeeeeee.dirty

### Can you explain your modified semver sort?

Sure. Standard semver sorts words alphabetically. This is not wanted if you're going to be creating tags like `v0.1.0-dev` and `v0.1.0-alpha`. You want to alpha sort everything except 'dev', 'alpha', 'beta', and 'rc', where those are ordered and always bigger than any other word. Thats it.

## Adding to your build

### As a release

```groovy
buildscript {
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath 'com.palantir:gradle-gitsemver:0.1.2'
  }
}
```

### As a snapshot

1. Add the sonatype snapshot repository to your buildscript repos
2. Add a buildscript dependency on `com.palantir:gradle-gitsemver`
3. Apply gitsemver to your project

Sample addition to your project:

```groovy
apply plugin: 'gitsemver'
buildscript {
  repositories {
    maven {
        url "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/"
    }
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath 'com.palantir:gradle-gitsemver:0.1.1-SNAPSHOT'
  }
}
```

Now verify that the version is being applied:

```bash
$ gradle properties | grep version
version: v0.0.0+58.g5f78071.dirty
```
